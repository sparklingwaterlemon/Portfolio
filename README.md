### Log:

#### 10/25:
- Got a template/layout using SquareSpace done
- Created basic ReactJS app layout, components, pages, etc.
- NPM install react-bootstrap bootstrap

#### 10/26:
- Coded the foundations for NavBar, sticky - scroll to component & CSS
- Coded the foundations for ScrollToTop and the CSS

#### 10/27:
- Working on NavBar Responsiveness

#### 10/28:
- Completed Responsive NavBar ease-in. 
- Worked on Hamburger Animation, transforming 3 lines to a X symbol. Most of the code is coded. Leaving in Ice Box, getting animation precisely lined up && getting it lined up over button click (CSS and JS adjustments) is taking up too much time.
- Deployed portfolio via Netlify - Change site name later - [moonlit-gelato.netlify.app](moonlit-gelato.netlify.app)

#### 10/29:
- Site Name in NavBar on click to top of page
- Using EmailJS, created a form to receive sent emails
- Begining using sweetalert to create a popup for sent email confirmation
